                Hi! smiling face
            <br>
            <br>
            I just wanted to wish you good luck for your law exams!
            <br>
            <br>
            Not that you need it of course, as I know you'll SMASH them because your Zeynep Ozkan and you are the greatest law student of all time.
            But still, a bit of luck never hurts winking face.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            It's been a privilidge getting to know you, and the fact that you are able to work so hard while being so sweet, kind, hilarious, and just all-round lovely is 
            as crazy as it is admirable.

            <br>
            <br>
            Only a few days/weeks, and then there's plenty of time for relaxing and doing jigsaws and eating oranges, you're almost there!

            <br>
            <br>
            Good luck my friend smiling face
            <br>
            <br>
            With love,
            <br>
            <br>
